# What is `npm` and `npx`

**`npm`** is the standard package manager for Node.js which gets installed with it. NPM helps to manage packages in your projects as dependencies. You can install a package **locally** i.e for you current local working project or **globally** i.e for your machine using `-g` when installing a package. For example.

```js
npm install lodash // local
npm install -g http-server //global
```

> #### Local install will create `node_modules` folder in the project directory and install the packages in it. <br> Global install will install the packages in the `npm` folder, located depending on the Operating System. <br>`npm list -g` to see the location.

---

**`npx`** is a tool that comes with **npm** version **5.2+** and is used to execute packages without installing them locally or globally.<br>
When you use `npx` to run a package it will first check if its installed locally and then globally, if not then it will check `npm-cache` folder at `C:/Users/{YourUserName}/AppData/Local/npm-cache` and if its not present, it will install the package in the `npm-cache` folder and run. For example.

```js
npx create-react-app my-app-name
```

This command utilizes `npx` to execute `create-react-app` without the need for a global or local installation. It creates a new React application named `my-app-name`. The `create-react-app` package is not installed locally or globally but is used temporarily to scaffold the React project.

> #### The whole point of **npx** is that you can run the packages without installing them somewhere permanent.

# Tilde (~) and carat (^) in `package.json`

Package.json is a configuration file for NPM and keeps a track of version number of the packages installed and the versions are written in **`0.0.0`** format, where first number stands for major release, second for the minor release and the third for the patch release / bug fixes.

Tilde **`~`** sign before our version number means that we can accept only a patch release when updating our package.

Caret **`^`** sign means that we can accept minor releases and patch releases, but not a major release when updating our package.

> #### If nothing is present before the version number the exact version will be used.

For example, we are using the **lodash** package in a project. We currently have version `3.8.0` installed. **Lodash** announces a new release with version number `3.9.0`.<br>
Our `package.json` file looks like below.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "~3.8.0"
},
```

When we update our packages, the **lodash** package will not update because we have specified not to accept a minor release using **`~`**

In order to accept this release we will need to change the **`~`** to **`^`** like below.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^3.8.0"
},
```

# Difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

**`package.json`** contains information about the project such as its name, version, author, and license. It also lists the project's dependencies on other Node.js packages, along with their version numbers, so that these dependencies can be automatically installed when the project is set up or updated.

**`package-lock.json`** on the other hand contains information about the dependencies/packages with their exact version numbers that were installed for a node.js project. It helps different developers working on the same repo to install the exact package versions installed previously, even if the packages have released new versions. This ensures the same **`node_modules`** across different machines/environments. This file is automatically generated or updated when there is a change in either the **`node_modules`** or package.json file.

# Difference between `devDependencies` and `dependencies`

When you install an npm package using **`npm install <package-name>`**, you are installing it as a dependency. The package is automatically listed in the `package.json` file, under the **`dependencies`** list. These are the packages our project needs to be able to work in production. For example - react, react-dom, uuid, etc.

When you add the **`-D`** flag, or **`--save-dev`**, you are installing it as a development dependency, which adds it to the **`devDependencies`** list. These packages are only required when developing our apps. For example - tailwindcss, jest, parcel, etc.

# Transitive dependency

A **Transitive dependency** refers to a dependency that is indirectly required by your project. When you install a package using **`npm`**, it might have its own dependencies, and those dependencies might have their own dependencies, and so on. Transitive dependencies are the dependencies that are not explicitly specified in your project's **`package.json`** file but are required by your direct dependencies aka the dependencies in your **`package.json`**.

# What is `.gitignore`

**`.gitignore`** is a configuration file used in git version control to specify files and directories that should be ignored when tracking changes in a Git repository. When you create a git repository for your project, git automatically tracks changes to all the files in the repository. However, there are often files or directories that you don't want to include, such as log files, files containing sensitive information, and temporary files.

By creating a **`.gitignore`** file in your git repository, you can list the files, directories, or file patterns that you want git to ignore. These ignored files will not be staged, committed, or tracked by git. The **`.gitignore`** file uses simple pattern matching to determine which files or directories to ignore. See below **`.gitignore`** file for example.

```js
*.log
/node_modules
```
