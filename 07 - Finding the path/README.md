# React Router

[**React Router**](https://reactrouter.com) is a popular library for routing in React applications. It allows developers to declaratively define routes and navigation between views in a **SPA** (Single Page Application) rather than loading entire new pages from a server.

# Client-side Routing vs Servers-side Routing

In **Client-side** routing, navigation occurs within the browser using JavaScript, enabling faster and smoother page transitions without full page reloads. This approach is common in Single Page Applications (SPAs), providing a dynamic user experience.

On the other hand, **Server-side** routing triggers a request to the server for each navigation action, resulting in complete page reloads. This method, typical of traditional multi-page applications, can lead to slower interactions due to the round-trip time between the client and server.

The choice between them impacts the user experience, responsiveness, and development approach of a web application.
